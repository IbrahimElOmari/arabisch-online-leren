## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Pre-Deploy Validation
```bash
# Run all checks
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm build

# Verify bundle sizes
ls -lh dist/assets/*.js
```

### Step 2: Database Migrations
```bash
# Apply any pending migrations
supabase db push

# Verify RLS policies
supabase db diff
```

### Step 3: Build for Production
```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf dist/
pnpm build

# Verify output
ls -R dist/
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Hosting
```bash
# Deploy via Lovable platform
# Or manual deployment:
# - Upload dist/ contents to hosting provider
# - Configure environment variables
# - Enable HTTPS
```

### Step 5: Post-Deploy Verification
```bash
# 1. Health check
curl https://yourdomain.com/functions/health

# 2. Check main routes
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/auth
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/dashboard

# 3. Verify SSL
openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443 -servername yourdomain.com
```

### Step 6: Smoke Tests
- [ ] Open site in browser
- [ ] Test authentication (login/logout)
- [ ] Navigate to all main sections
- [ ] Test a critical user flow (e.g., student enrollment)
- [ ] Check console for errors
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness

## üîÑ ROLLBACK PROCEDURE

If issues are detected after deployment:

### Immediate Rollback
```bash
# Option 1: Revert to previous version via hosting dashboard

# Option 2: Deploy previous working commit
git checkout <previous-commit>
pnpm build
# Deploy dist/
```

### Database Rollback
```bash
# If database changes need rollback
supabase db reset --db-url <production-url>
# Then reapply migrations up to previous version
```

## üìä POST-DEPLOYMENT MONITORING

### First 24 Hours
Monitor these metrics:
- Error rate (should be < 1%)
- Response time (p95 < 500ms)
- User authentication success rate
- Page load times (LCP < 2.5s)

### Week 1
- User feedback collection
- Performance trends
- Error patterns
- Database query performance

### Alerts to Configure
- Error rate spike (> 5%)
- Response time degradation (> 1s p95)
- Database connection issues
- High memory usage (> 80%)

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

#### Build Fails
```bash
# Clear cache and retry
rm -rf node_modules dist .vite
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

#### Database Connection Errors
- Verify Supabase URL and key
- Check network connectivity
- Verify RLS policies
- Check database logs

#### High Memory Usage
- Check for memory leaks in components
- Verify lazy loading is working
- Review bundle size

#### Slow Page Load
- Check CDN configuration
- Verify image optimization
- Review bundle splitting
- Check network waterfall
